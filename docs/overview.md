## üß† Design Philosophy

Osrovnet is built on the following principles:

- Modularity ‚Äî Microservice architecture for scalable deployment
- Security-first Engineering ‚Äî Quantum-safe encryption, RBAC enforcement
- Editorial Clarity ‚Äî Semantic UI for rapid decision-making
- Sovereign Hosting ‚Äî Offshore compatibility and regulatory flexibility

---

## Quick Start (for operators)

1. Provision Osrovnet into your chosen infrastructure (VMs, Kubernetes, or managed hosting).
2. Configure trusted network ranges and initial scan targets.
3. Connect a threat feed (STIX/TAXII) and ingest baseline IOCs.
4. Create roles and seed administrative accounts with MFA enabled.
5. Schedule a baseline network scan and review the first report for high-severity findings.

---

## Notes & Recommendations

- Keep backup keys and secrets in an offline, secure vault.
- Regularly review and rotate API keys and service credentials.
- Use staging environments to validate upgrades and playbooks before production rollout.

If you'd like, I can:

- Convert this single page into a full documentation site structure (multiple markdown files + sidebar),
- Add a short README snippet linking to this docs page,
- Run a spell/consistency check and apply small stylistic edits (tone, capitalization, abbreviations).

Which of these should I do next?
